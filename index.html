<!--           <p style="font-size:13px" class="justified">We propose a novel deep learning system for single image HDR reconstruction by synthesizing visually pleasing details in the saturated areas. We introduce a new feature masking approach that reduces the contribution of the features computed on the saturated areas, to mitigate halo and checkerboard artifacts. To synthesize visually pleasing textures in the saturated regions, we adapt the VGG-based perceptual loss function to the HDR reconstruction application. Furthermore, to effectively train our network on limited HDR training data, we propose to pre-train the network on inpainting task. Our method can reconstruct regions with high luminance, such as the bright highlights of the windows (red inset), and generate visually pleasing textures (green insert). See Figure 7 for comparison against several other approaches. All images have been gamma corrected for display purposes.</p> -->

        <h1>Abstract</h1>
        <p class="justified">Monoscopic panorama provides the display of omnidirectional contents surrounding the viewer. An increasingly popular way to reconstruct a panorama is to stitch a collection of fisheye images. However, such non-planar views may result in problems such as distortions and boundary irregularities. In most cases, the computational expense for stitching non-planar images is also too high to satisfy real-time applications. In this paper, a novel monoscopic panorama reconstruction pipeline that produces better quad-fisheye image stitching results for omnidirectional environment viewing is proposed. The main idea is to apply mesh deformation for image alignment. To optimize inter-lens parallaxes, unwarped images are firstly cropped and reshuffled to facilitate the circular environment scene composition by the seamless ring-connection of the panorama borders. Several mesh constraints are then adopted to ensure a high alignment accuracy. After alignment, the boundary of the result is rectified to be rectangular to prevent gapping artifacts. We further extend our approach to video stitching. The temporal smoothness model is added to prevent unexpected artifacts in the panoramic videos. To support interactive applications, our stitching algorithm is programmed using CUDA. The camera motion and average gradient per video frame are further calculated to accelerate for synchronous real-life panoramic scene reconstruction and visualization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method has advantages in respects of alignment accuracy, adaptability and image quality of the stitching result.</p>
